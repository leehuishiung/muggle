                    25 memes of the web&rsquo;s first 25 years By Gene Park, Adriana Usero and Chris Rukan For more of The Web at 25, visit The Washington Post. Memes didn&rsquo;t begin with the Web, but you&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking so. The evolutionary biologist Richard
                    Dawkins coined the term in his 1976 book, &ldquo;The Selfish Gene,&rdquo; to describe something that already existed. A meme, from the Greek &ldquo;mimeme&rdquo; (to imitate) was &ldquo;a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.&rdquo; This encompassed phenomena
                    from Martin Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;95 Theses&rdquo; to the famous graffiti drawing &ldquo;Kilroy Was Here,&rdquo; which dates to the beginning of World War II. But the Web has proved to be the most fertile ground, and the site Know Your Meme has confirmed more than 2,600
                    of them. Below, 25 definitive memes from the Web&rsquo;s first 25 years. [1] Dancing Baby 1996: Considered the granddaddy of Internet memes, the baby shuffling to Blue Swede&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hooked on a Feeling&rdquo; filled inboxes and prime-time airwaves, appearing
                    in several episodes of &ldquo;Ally McBeal.&rdquo; The file was originally included with early 3D software. LucasFilm developers modified it before it was widely shared, and it was finally compressed into one of the first GIFs.
